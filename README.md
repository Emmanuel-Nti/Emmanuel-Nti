- 👋 Hi, I’m Emmanuel Nti.
- 👀 I’m interested in analytics.
- 🌱 I have recently graduated from a 9-month intensive Data Analysis training with [Practicum100 by Yandex](https://www.practicum100.com/) where I independently and successfully completed numerous hands-on and insightful projects on statistical data analysis, A/B testing, KPI analysis, etc., using Python, SQL, MS Office, and Tableau. I'm also a master's graduate in economics with a postgraduate diploma in data science. I am as well a Chartered Financial Economist :)
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to my next challenge in an analytics-related position or collaboration on data-related tasks. 
- 📫 Contact me via my email: ntioes@gmail.com
