- 👋 Hi, I’m Emmanuel Nti.
- 👀 I’m interested in analytics.
- 🌱 I have recently graduated from a Data Analysis training with [Practicum100 by Yandex](https://www.practicum100.com/) where I independently and successfully completed numerous hands-on and insighful projects on statistical data analysis, A/B testing, KPI analysis, etc., using Python, SQL, MS Office, and Tableau. I'm also a master graduate in economics with a postgraduate diploma in data science. Oh and I am as well a Chartered Financial Economist :)
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to my next challenge in an anlytics related position or collaboration on data related tasks.
