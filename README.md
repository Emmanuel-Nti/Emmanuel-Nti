- 👋 Hi, I’m Emmanuel Nti.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis.
- 🌱 I have recently graduated from a Data Analysis training with [Practicum100 by Yandex](https://www.practicum100.com/) where I independently and successfully completed numerous hands-on and insighful projects on statistical data analysis, A/B testing, KPI analysis, etc., using Python, SQL, MS Office, and Tableau.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to my next challenge in a data related position or collaboration on data related tasks. 
- 📫 Contact me via my email: ntioes@gmail.com
